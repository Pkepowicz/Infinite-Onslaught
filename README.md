# Infinite Onslaught
Minimalistic 2D online shooter game with client and server made in Godot game engine by Paweł Kępowicz and Dominik Dziechciarz. 
You can download the client from [here](https://alavon.itch.io/infinite-onslaught) and try it yourself! The server is working inside a Docker container that allows for scalability and is hosted on the free tier of Oracle Cloud Service to minimize costs. 
This project is a reimagining of my previous project, [shooters-servers-security](https://github.com/Pkepowicz/shooter-servers-and-security), that was remade from the ground up due to the inefficiency of using Python's Pygame for game development.

## Example of gameplay:
